Each chapter contains a tutorial project. Complete the instructions in the chapter, using the student data files (under Resources). 
When you have completed the tutorial project, create a directory for the project on your server account, and upload the files to that directory. 
Provide the link to your directory in the assignment text submission here.

In this chapter, you’ll work on a web site for Life on Rocks Wildlife Cruises, a company in Monterey, California, that offers boat trips to view marine animals and seabirds. 
The main page of the site has been designed, and you’ve been hired to add drop-down menus to the navigation section. 
The design specifies that when a user moves the mouse pointer over a navigation bar item, the submenu showing its related options should be displayed. 
When the user moves the mouse pointer off that navigation bar item, the submenu should be hidden. 
Although you could create these drop-down menus using the JavaScript concepts you’ve learned in the preceding chapters, jQuery enables you to create this feature using 
much less code, so you’ll use the jQuery library for this task.
